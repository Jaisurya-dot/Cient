    title: "1. Clearly Define Your Product Requirements",
    description: `Before you contact any supplier, make sure you have a detailed brief that includes:

- Exact product specifications (size, color, materials, features)
- Required quality standards and certifications
- Expected order quantity
- Packaging and labeling needs

Clear, detailed requirements help prevent misunderstandings and costly mistakes later in the process.`
  },
  {
    title: "2. Select Verified and Trusted Suppliers",
    description: `Supplier reliability is critical. We recommend:

- Verifying business licenses and certifications
- Checking references and independent reviews
- Using platforms with supplier verification (like Alibaba Gold Supplier or Made-in-China Audited Supplier)
- Working with a sourcing partner who has a local, on-ground team

At Sino India Jeda Trading, our Beijing team personally vets every supplier in our network, so you always work with trusted partners.`
  },
  {
    title: "3. Request Samples and Conduct Quality Checks",
    description: `Never skip the sampling phase. Always:

- Request product samples before placing a bulk order
- Arrange for factory audits and in-process inspections
- Conduct pre-shipment quality checks

This approach ensures your products consistently meet your expectations.`
  },
  {
    title: "4. Negotiate Terms Wisely",
    description: `Price is just one part of the equation. Also negotiate:

- Unit pricing and discounts for larger orders
- Payment terms (e.g., 30% deposit, 70% upon shipment)
- Delivery schedules and incoterms (FOB, CIF, DDP)
- After-sales support

Transparent, well-negotiated agreements build long-term supplier relationships.`
  },

- Clearing customs and paying duties

Our team helps you manage these steps to avoid delays and unexpected costs.`
  },
  {
    title: "6. Maintain Regular Communication",
